# HinDroid

This repository is a thorough implementation attempt at the [Hindroid](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~yqsong/papers/2017-KDD-HINDROID.pdf) paper (DOI:[10.1145/3097983.3098026](https://doi.org/10.1145/3097983.3098026)).

The task of interest here is to effectively classify Android applications as benign or malicious. Malicious applications pose security threats to the public as they often intentionally obtain sensitive information from the victim's phone. Our intent is to replicate the findings presented in this paper by sourcing the data by ourselves and then applying machine learning techniques mentioned on the data we acquired.
